# IPSX Desktop Client

IPSX is a decentralized exchange for sharing IPs and a framework for building applications, on top of the existing IPs shared by the community members and data centers.

A smart contract based, blockchain protocols and utility token incentivized mechanism of sharing IPs among actors from all over the world and a framework to build applications that require IPs built in a reliable and open source environment.

The IPSX Desktop client will allow our users to easily set up new IPs and protect his internet connection using the IPSX framework.
